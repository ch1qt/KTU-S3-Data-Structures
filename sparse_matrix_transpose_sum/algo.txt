Algorithm for Transpose and Sum of Two Sparse Matrices:

1.  **Represent Sparse Matrix:**
    *   A sparse matrix can be represented using a structure that stores only the non-zero elements.
    *   Each non-zero element needs its row index, column index, and value.
    *   A common representation is an array of structures: `struct Element { int row; int col; int value; };`
    *   The first element of this array can store the dimensions of the matrix (rows, columns) and the total number of non-zero elements.

2.  **Input Sparse Matrices:**
    *   Read the dimensions (rows, columns) and the number of non-zero elements for the first sparse matrix.
    *   Read the row, column, and value for each non-zero element and store them in an array of `Element` structures.
    *   Repeat for the second sparse matrix.

3.  **Transpose of a Sparse Matrix:**
    *   Create a new array for the transposed matrix.
    *   The number of rows and columns will be swapped.
    *   Iterate through the original sparse matrix's non-zero elements:
        *   For each element `(row, col, value)`, add an element `(col, row, value)` to the transposed matrix.
    *   Sort the transposed matrix elements by row, then by column (optional but good for standard representation).

4.  **Sum of Two Sparse Matrices:**
    *   **Pre-condition:** Check if both matrices have the same dimensions (rows and columns). If not, summation is not possible.
    *   Create a new array for the resulting sum matrix.
    *   Use two pointers, one for each input sparse matrix, starting from the first non-zero element.
    *   Compare the row and column indices of the elements pointed to by the two pointers:
        *   **If (row1, col1) == (row2, col2):** Add their values. If the sum is non-zero, add a new element `(row1, col1, sum_value)` to the result matrix. Move both pointers.
        *   **If (row1, col1) < (row2, col2):** (e.g., row1 < row2, or row1 == row2 and col1 < col2) Add the element from matrix 1 to the result matrix. Move pointer of matrix 1.
        *   **If (row2, col2) < (row1, col1):** Add the element from matrix 2 to the result matrix. Move pointer of matrix 2.
    *   **Handle Remaining Elements:** After one matrix is exhausted, add all remaining elements of the other matrix to the result matrix.

5.  **Display Matrices:**
    *   Print the original, transposed, and sum matrices in a readable format (e.g., showing only non-zero elements or reconstructing the full matrix for small examples).
