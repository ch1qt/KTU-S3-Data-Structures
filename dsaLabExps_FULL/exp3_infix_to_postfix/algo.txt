Algorithm: Infix to Postfix Conversion and Evaluation

Part 1: Infix to Postfix Conversion

1. Initialize:
   - Create an empty stack for operators.
   - Create an empty string or character array for the postfix expression.

2. Scan the Infix Expression:
   - Iterate through the infix expression from left to right, token by token (operands, operators, parentheses).

3. Process Tokens:
   - If the token is an operand (a number or a variable):
     - Append it to the postfix expression.
   - If the token is an operator:
     - While the stack is not empty, the top of the stack is not a left parenthesis, and the precedence of the current operator is less than or equal to the precedence of the operator on top of the stack:
       - Pop an operator from the stack and append it to the postfix expression.
     - Push the current operator onto the stack.
   - If the token is a left parenthesis (:
     - Push it onto the stack.
   - If the token is a right parenthesis ):
     - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is not a left parenthesis:
       - Pop an operator from the stack and append it to the postfix expression.
     - Pop the left parenthesis from the stack (and discard it).

4. Finalize:
   - After scanning the entire infix expression, while the stack is not empty:
     - Pop any remaining operators from the stack and append them to the postfix expression.

5. Output:
   - The resulting string or character array is the postfix expression.

Part 2: Postfix Expression Evaluation

1. Initialize:
   - Create an empty stack for operands (numbers).

2. Scan the Postfix Expression:
   - Iterate through the postfix expression from left to right, token by token.

3. Process Tokens:
   - If the token is an operand (a number):
     - Push it onto the operand stack.
   - If the token is an operator:
     - Pop the top two operands from the stack (let's call them operand2 and operand1).
     - Perform the operation: result = operand1 operator operand2.
     - Push the result back onto the operand stack.

4. Finalize:
   - After scanning the entire postfix expression, the final result will be the only value remaining on the stack.

5. Output:
   - Pop the result from the stack and return it.

Operator Precedence:

- ^ (Exponentiation) - Highest precedence
- *, / (Multiplication, Division) - Medium precedence
- +, - (Addition, Subtraction) - Lowest precedence
- Parentheses () are used to override precedence.
