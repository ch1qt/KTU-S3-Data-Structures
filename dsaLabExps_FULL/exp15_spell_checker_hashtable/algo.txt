Algorithm: Spell Checker using Hash Table

Problem Description:
Implement a spell checker that uses a hash table to store a dictionary of words for fast lookup. It should include functions to check if a word is valid and to suggest corrections for misspelled words.

Data Structures:

HashTable: An array of linked lists (or other collision resolution mechanism).
    // Each entry in the hash table will store a word (string).

Part 1: Hash Table Implementation

1. Hash Function:
   - Takes a string (word) as input.
   - Returns an integer index within the bounds of the hash table array size.
   - Example: Sum of ASCII values of characters, modulo table size.

2. `insertWord(hashTable, word)`:
   - Calculate hash index for the `word`.
   - Insert `word` into the linked list at that index.

3. `searchWord(hashTable, word)`:
   - Calculate hash index for the `word`.
   - Search for `word` in the linked list at that index.
   - Return `true` if found, `false` otherwise.

Part 2: Spell Checker Functions

1. `checkWord(hashTable, word)`:

   Function checkWord(hashTable: HashTable, word: string) -> boolean:
       Return searchWord(hashTable, word)

2. `suggestCorrections(hashTable, misspelled_word)`:

   Function suggestCorrections(hashTable: HashTable, misspelled_word: string) -> list of strings:
       suggestions = empty list
       word_length = length(misspelled_word)

       // 1. Single character deletions
       For i from 0 to word_length - 1:
           temp_word = misspelled_word with character at index i deleted
           If checkWord(hashTable, temp_word):
               Add temp_word to suggestions

       // 2. Single character insertions
       For i from 0 to word_length:
           For each character 'a' through 'z':
               temp_word = misspelled_word with character 'c' inserted at index i
               If checkWord(hashTable, temp_word):
                   Add temp_word to suggestions

       // 3. Single character substitutions
       For i from 0 to word_length - 1:
           original_char = misspelled_word[i]
           For each character 'a' through 'z':
               temp_word = misspelled_word with character at index i replaced by 'c'
               If checkWord(hashTable, temp_word):
                   Add temp_word to suggestions

       // 4. Adjacent character swaps (transpositions)
       For i from 0 to word_length - 2:
           temp_word = misspelled_word with characters at index i and i+1 swapped
           If checkWord(hashTable, temp_word):
               Add temp_word to suggestions

       Return unique suggestions from the list

Main Program Flow:

1. Initialize hash table.
2. Load dictionary words into the hash table (e.g., from a file).
3. Prompt user for a word to check.
4. Call `checkWord`.
5. If `checkWord` returns `false`, call `suggestCorrections` and display suggestions.
