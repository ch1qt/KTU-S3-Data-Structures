Algorithm: Customer Priority Management using Priority Queue

Problem Description:
Manage customer service based on priority categories: Differently abled, Senior citizen, Defence personnel, Ordinary. The preference order is: Differently abled > Senior citizen > Defence personnel > Ordinary. Generate the possible sequence of completion.

Data Structures:

Structure Customer:
    id: integer
    category: string (e.g., "Differently abled", "Senior citizen", etc.)
    priority_value: integer (e.g., 4 for Differently abled, 3 for Senior citizen, 2 for Defence, 1 for Ordinary)

PriorityQueue: A data structure that stores customers and allows efficient retrieval of the highest priority customer.
    // Can be implemented using a max-heap or a sorted linked list.

Algorithm Steps:

1. Define Priority Levels:
   - Assign numerical priority values to each category:
     - Differently abled: 4 (Highest)
     - Senior citizen: 3
     - Defence personnel: 2
     - Ordinary: 1 (Lowest)

2. Function `addCustomer(priorityQueue, customer_id, customer_category)`:

   Function addCustomer(priorityQueue: PriorityQueue, customer_id: integer, customer_category: string):
       customer = new Customer()
       customer.id = customer_id
       customer.category = customer_category
       customer.priority_value = getPriorityValue(customer_category)
       Insert customer into priorityQueue based on priority_value

3. Function `serveNextCustomer(priorityQueue)`:

   Function serveNextCustomer(priorityQueue: PriorityQueue) -> Customer:
       If priorityQueue is empty:
           Return NULL (no customers to serve)
       Else:
           customer = ExtractMax(priorityQueue) // Get and remove the highest priority customer
           Return customer

4. Main Simulation Logic:

   Function simulateCustomerService():
       priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue()

       // Example: Add some customers
       addCustomer(priorityQueue, 101, "Ordinary")
       addCustomer(priorityQueue, 102, "Senior citizen")
       addCustomer(priorityQueue, 103, "Defence personnel")
       addCustomer(priorityQueue, 104, "Differently abled")
       addCustomer(priorityQueue, 105, "Ordinary")
       addCustomer(priorityQueue, 106, "Senior citizen")

       Print "Customer Service Order:"
       While priorityQueue is not empty:
           servedCustomer = serveNextCustomer(priorityQueue)
           If servedCustomer is not NULL:
               Print "Serving Customer ID: ", servedCustomer.id, ", Category: ", servedCustomer.category

Implementation Details (Priority Queue):

- Max-Heap: A common and efficient way to implement a priority queue. `Insert` and `ExtractMax` operations take O(log N) time.
- Sorted Linked List: Simpler to implement but `Insert` can take O(N) time in the worst case, and `ExtractMax` takes O(1).

For this implementation, we will consider a simple array-based max-heap for the priority queue.
