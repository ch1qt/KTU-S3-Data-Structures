Algorithm: Maximum Activity Points with K Events

Problem Description:
Given an array `A` of activity points for `n` events, and an integer `k` representing the maximum number of events you can participate in, find the maximum total activity points you can earn.

Analysis:
This problem is a classic selection problem. To maximize the total points, we should choose the `k` events that offer the highest activity points.

Algorithm Steps:

1. Input:
   - An array `A` of `n` integers representing activity points.
   - An integer `k` representing the maximum number of events to choose.

2. Sort the Array:
   - Sort the array `A` in descending order. This places the events with the highest activity points at the beginning of the array.

3. Calculate Maximum Points:
   - Initialize a variable `max_points` to 0.
   - Iterate from `i = 0` to `k - 1` (or until the end of the array if `k > n`).
   - In each iteration, add the value of `A[i]` to `max_points`.

4. Output:
   - Return `max_points`.

Example:

- `A = {10, 5, 20, 8, 15}`
- `k = 3`

1. Sort `A` in descending order: `A_sorted = {20, 15, 10, 8, 5}`
2. Calculate `max_points`:
   - `max_points = A_sorted[0] + A_sorted[1] + A_sorted[2]`
   - `max_points = 20 + 15 + 10 = 45`
3. Output: `45`

Implementation Notes:
- Any standard sorting algorithm (like Quick Sort or Merge Sort) can be used.
- The time complexity will be dominated by the sorting step, which is typically O(n log n).
